## Requirements for Additions

There are generally three types of Content Management Systems:

1. Dynamic Servers (e.g. WordPress, Ghost, DocPad, Harp) — these allow you to have re-render on every request abilities
2. Flat File CMS (e.g. Jekyll, DocPad) — these allow you to write your content as files
3. Static Site Generators (e.g. Jekyll, DocPad) — these generate a static website from your input that you can deploy anywhere

Currently, this listing is for only projects that are either or both a Flat File CMS and Static Site Generator, but not for projects which are only Dynamic Servers (such as WordPress and Ghost).

If you would actually like a listing of all Content Management Systems, where you can browse by their types. [Let us know in this discussion.](https://github.com/jaspervdj/static-site-generator-comparison/issues/52)
